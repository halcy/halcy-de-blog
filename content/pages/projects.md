Title: Projects

I have some projects that I like that I don't really have listed anywhere because they don't really fit anywhere. Here's those, in no
particular order, but probably it is recency.

CYBER DEFENSE 2200
------------------

During AGDQ, I participated in a game jam, [GAMES MADE QUICK???](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick/rate/111740). 
[CYBER DEFENSE 2200](https://halcy.itch.io/cyber-defense-2200) is the result of that. It's a fairly simple-minded space shooter,
with a very 8-bit aesthetic, not the least because it uses fixed point math, software rasterization and a RGB332 palette throughout. There's
a soundtrack with four tracked songs, and [@SaltyTuna](https://twitter.com/SaltyTuna) made some cute art for the title/game over/you win screens!

You can find a few binaries (Windows, Ubuntu, OS X) [on itch.io](https://halcy.itch.io/cyber-defense-2200). Source code is [available on
github](https://halcy.itch.io/cyber-defense-2200).

Quasicrystals-Bot
-----------------

Quasicrystals-Bot is a twitter and mastodon bot that generates short, looping, animated gifs of [quasi-crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal) 
like structures and then posts them. What they look like varies greatly, here are some examples:

![Quasicrystal gif loop.]({filename}/images/2035812253.gif "Quasicrystal gif loop.") | ![Quasicrystal gif loop.]({filename}/images/1577933691.gif "Quasicrystal gif loop.") | ![Quasicrystal gif loop.]({filename}/images/1651526861.gif "Quasicrystal gif loop.")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can follow the bot on [twitter](https://twitter.com/quasi_crystals) or [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/users/quasi_crystals), and you can even 
request to have it generate a gif seeded with your own handle, your own, personal quasi-crystal (just send it a mention). You can also check out [its
source code on github](https://github.com/halcy/quasi_crystals_bot/) if you are curious how it works -- be warned, though, it is particularly terrible. On twitter, it follows some
other algorithmic art bots -- if you know one it doesn't, or if you made one, even, let me know, I'm a big fan of such things!
